‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**:  WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It's not meant for unauthorized access or malicious activities. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen relies on the well-established [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin wallet generation.  For EVM-based chains such as Ethereum, the software leverages the [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing algorithm.

The core process of WalletGen is to generate a multitude of potential wallet addresses, and then verify their current balance. This is accomplished either by conducting live balance checks against public blockchain explorers, or, much more efficiently, by comparing the generated addresses against a pre-existing database of known wallets which contain funds. The C++ foundation of WalletGen allows for significantly faster speeds than many of the Python based alternatives, with the overall speed mainly relying on your CPU and GPU.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** employs brute-force methods for searching wallets with balances.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Search:

*   Press `3` in the menu or run `start_search_btc.bat` to search Bitcoin wallets over the internet. This may take longer since it does real-time balance checks.
*   Press `6` to search using the database. This is faster as it compares generated wallets with a database.

### EVM Wallet Search (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press `5` or run `start_search_evm.bat` for an internet-based search. Balances are checked in real-time with blockchain explorers.
*   Press `6` to use the database. This is faster as it compares against the known database.

### Speed Considerations:

*   Your hardware, especially the graphics card (GPU), greatly affects search speed. Run multiple instances (1 to 4) to increase your chances.

Databases improve search efficiency by avoiding the need for real-time blockchain queries.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

If WalletGen finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search will **Stop** immediately.
*   The wallet details are **Displayed** in the console.
*   The data is **Saved** in the `found_wallets.txt` file.

### How to Access the Funds?

1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** into any compatible crypto wallet (such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, or Electrum).
2.  You can then transfer the funds to your own wallet.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen can help you recover your Bitcoin wallet using the seed phrase. Enter the full phrase, or use wildcards to search for missing words.

### Process Description

#### Search for Missing Words:

Use * if words are missing. WalletGen checks all combinations.

#### Entering a Complete Seed Phrase:

If you have all 12 words, enter them. WalletGen then generates and checks addresses.

### Important Recommendations

*   Seed phrases have 12 words.
*   Use * only for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words can take time.
*   Upon recovery, data is saved.

## My Finds
